= Initial Entity Values

In this guide, you will learn how to set up initial values for entities in Jmix. Initial values are a key feature that can streamline data entry processes and ensure consistency across your application. We will explore different approaches to define these values, from simple attribute defaults to more dynamic options using lifecycle events and UI-level initialization.

The guide covers three main methods for setting initial values in entities—direct attribute assignment, lifecycle event handling, and UI-based initialization—using practical examples. By the end of this guide, you will understand how to effectively apply each method in your Jmix applications to improve usability and maintain reliable default data.

[[what-we-are-going-to-build]]
== What We Are Going to Build

This guide enhances the https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix-petclinic-2[Jmix Petclinic^] example with practical use cases for setting initial values in entities. Through real-world examples, we demonstrate how to implement and interact with various initialization methods to ensure seamless user experiences and accurate data management.

The application includes the following scenarios:

- **Direct Attribute Assignment**: Learn how to set default values for simple attributes like `Boolean` or `Integer` directly in the entity class.

- **Lifecycle Event Handling**: Use Jmix lifecycle events such as `@PostConstruct` to initialize more complex attributes dynamically.

- **UI-Based Initialization**: Understand how to define initial values when entities are created via the user interface, using the `InitEntityEvent` listener in standard views.


[[entity-field-initialization]]
== Entity Fields Initialization

Entity fields can be initialized in two main ways: by setting default values directly in the field definition or by using a lifecycle callback method with `@PostConstruct`. These approaches serve different purposes depending on the complexity and requirements of the initialization logic.

[[default-values]]
=== Default Values

Simple attributes (e.g., `Boolean`, `Integer`) and enumerations can be initialized directly in the field declaration of an entity class. In the Petclinic example, the `Visit` entity has an attribute `paid`, which is a boolean flag indicating whether a visit has already been paid. This value should, by default, be `FALSE`. The default value can be set directly in the field definition:

.Visit.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/visit/Visit.java[tags=start-class;paid-default-value;end-class]
----

This approach is simple and efficient for static default values that do not depend on external factors or dynamic calculations.


[[post-construct-initialization]]
=== PostConstruct Initialization

The `@PostConstruct` annotation allows you to execute custom initialization logic after an entity instance has been created. This method is called once the object is fully initialized, but before it is used. This is particularly useful for initializing fields that depend on more complex logic or external methods.

The `@PostConstruct` method is invoked in the following scenarios:

- When an instance is programmatically created using `metadata.create(Visit.class)` or `dataManager.create(Visit.class)`.
- When an instance is created by the UI framework during user interaction.
- When an instance is created by the generic REST API.

Here’s an example of a `PostConstruct` method in the `Visit` entity:
To set a static default value for the `visitStatus` field, you can use a simple `@PostConstruct` method:

.Visit.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/visit/Visit.java[tags=start-class;post-construct-init;end-class]
----
<1> The `@PostConstruct` annotation ensures the method is executed after the entity is fully initialized.
<2> The `treatmentStatus` field is set to the predefined value `UPCOMING` if it has not already been initialized.

[NOTE]
====
The name of the method, `initTreatmentStatus`, is arbitrary. You can use any name, as long as the method is annotated with `@PostConstruct`.

It is also possible to define multiple methods with the `@PostConstruct` annotation in the same class. This allows you to separate initialization logic into smaller, focused methods. However, the execution order of these methods is not guaranteed and should not be relied upon.
====

At the time the `@PostConstruct` method is invoked, no values from the user interface or external sources (e.g., REST API inputs) have been set on the entity. This method is executed immediately after the entity instance is created. Therefore, it is not suitable for initialization logic that depends on pre-existing field values.

[[dependency-injection]]
==== Dependency Injection

In many cases, it is not sufficient to initialize fields with static values or predefined logic. Initialization often requires dynamic values based on the application's runtime context, such as the current timestamp, user-specific settings, or other managed components. To support this, Spring-managed beans can be injected directly into the parameters of a `@PostConstruct` method.

For example, consider initializing a timestamp field in the `Visit` entity. Using the `TimeSource` bean provided by the Jmix framework, you can dynamically retrieve the current system time and set it as a default value:

.Visit.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/visit/Visit.java[tags=start-class;post-construct-dependency-injection;end-class]
----
<1> The `@PostConstruct` annotation marks the method to be executed after the entity is fully initialized.
<2> The `TimeSource` bean is injected directly into the method, providing access to the current system time.
<3> If the `visitStart` field has not been set, it is initialized with the current time.

By using Spring Bean Injection, you can access framework APIs and custom beans directly in your initialization logic. This allows you to handle context-specific data and implement more flexible and dynamic entity initialization.

[[ui-layer-initialization]]
== UI-Layer Initialization

On the UI layer, there are two main ways to initialize an entity during view creation. The first one is **internal**, within the view controller that shows the newly created entity. The second one is **external**, where the entity is initialized by the code that opens the destination view.

[[internal-initialization]]
=== Internal Initialization via InitEntityEvent

The first approach is to perform the entity initialization within the destination view controller itself. In Jmix, this can be achieved using UI events, such as the `InitEntityEvent`. This event is specifically designed to allow initialization logic for newly created entities. For more details, see: xref:flow-ui:views/view-events.adoc#init-entity-event[Flow UI: Init Entity Event].

For example, in the Petclinic application, this internal initialization is used to set the `type` of a `Visit` to `REGULAR_CHECKUP`:

.VisitDetailView.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/view/visit/VisitDetailView.java[tags=init-entity-event]
----
<1> The `onInitEntity` method subscribes to the `InitEntityEvent` triggered for the newly created `Visit` instance.
<2> The `type` field is set to `REGULAR_CHECKUP`, providing a sensible default value.

The advantage of this approach is its simplicity and minimal required code changes. It is a good fit for scenarios where specific attributes, which are not dynamic, need to be initialized. However, since it is scoped to the destination view, it is less flexible for reacting to external parameters passed into the view.

[[external-initialization-create-action]]
=== External Initialization via Create Action Initializer

Another way to initialize entity attributes externally is by using the `initializer` method of a `Create` action. This approach allows you to define custom initialization logic for new entities created via standard actions, providing a non-invasive way to set default values.

In contrast to the internal initialization approach, this method offers more flexibility by allowing access to the context of the `ListView`. For example, you can incorporate user inputs or other dynamic information available in the current view when initializing the entity. At the same time, it avoids the need for extensive modifications to the standard behavior of the `Create` action, keeping the implementation simple and easy to maintain.

In the example below, the `initializer` method is used to set the `healthStatus` of a `Pet` entity to `UNKNOWN` whenever a new `Pet` is created through the `petsDataGrid.create` action.

.PetListView.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/view/pet/pet/PetListView.java[tags=start-class;create-initializer;end-class]
----
<1> The `@Install` annotation connects this method to the `initializer` property of the `Create` action for the `petsDataGrid` component. The `initializer` is responsible for customizing the default state of the entity instance when a new entity is created through this action. By using this mechanism, you can ensure specific fields are pre-filled or set with default values at the moment of entity creation.
<2> The `Pet` entity instance is passed as a parameter to the method. This instance represents the new entity being created, allowing you to modify its initial state.
<3> The `setHealthStatus` method is used to set the default value for the `healthStatus` field of the `Pet` entity to `UNKNOWN`.

This method is ideal when the initialization logic is relatively simple and does not require additional user interaction or complex workflows.

[[external-initialization-dialogs-api]]
=== External Initialization via Dialog Windows API

In some scenarios, the standard actions like `create` and `edit` may not fully accommodate the level of customization required. For example, you might need to present an intermediate dialog for user input or perform additional operations before initializing and displaying the new entity. In such cases, the **Dialog Windows API** provides a flexible alternative.

Using the Dialog Windows API, you can programmatically open views and configure their behavior before they are displayed. This includes defining an initializer that sets default values for the entity being created.

For instance, in the `VisitListView`, the Dialog Windows API is used to create a new `Visit` entity for a "regular checkup". The process involves selecting a `Pet` first, then passing that selection along with additional initialization logic to the detail view for creating the new `Visit`:

.VisitListView.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/view/visit/VisitListView.java[tags=create-regular-checkup-dialog-windows]
----
<1> A lookup dialog is opened to allow the user to select a pet for the visit.
<2> The `dialogWindows.detail` API is used to open a detail view for creating the new `Visit` instance.
<3> The `newEntity` method ensures that a new `Visit` instance is created.
<4> The `withInitializer` method is used to set the default values for the `Visit` instance, such as `type`, `description`, and `pet`.

This approach provides greater flexibility and customization for workflows that require more complex interactions or dependencies. It’s an excellent fit for use cases where the initialization logic depends on user input or additional context from other entities.

Now, let’s take a look at the corresponding UI screens for this workflow:

[[when-to-use-which]]
== Choosing the Right Initialization Approach

Different initialization approaches are suited for different use cases. The choice depends on the context in which the entity is created and the level of control or customization required. Below is a comparison of the main approaches and their characteristics to help you decide which one to use.

[[comparison-matrix]]
=== Comparison Matrix

The table below summarizes the main differences between the initialization approaches:

[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Approach
| Applicability
| Scope
| Notes

| xref:#default-values[]
| Always applied
| Entity-wide
| Applied regardless of how the entity is created (Generic REST API, programmatic creation, UI actions, etc.). Best for simple static default values.

| xref:#post-construct-initialization[]
| Always applied
| Entity-wide
| Similar to direct attribute assignment but allows for dynamic logic, such as invoking services or beans. Best for default values requiring more complex initialization logic.

| xref:#internal-initialization[]
| UI-only
| View-specific
| Logic is scoped to the specific UI screen where the entity is created. Cannot handle broader contexts like REST API or programmatic creation.

| xref:external-initialization-create-action[]
| UI-only
| Calling view-specific
| Allows additional customization within the calling view. Useful when contextual information from the view is needed for initialization.

| xref:external-initialization-dialogs-api[]
| UI-only
| Fully customizable
| Suitable for workflows that require additional user input or intermediate steps (e.g., opening dialogs or gathering related entity data).
|===

=== Key Considerations

* **Entity-level initialization**: Approaches like **Direct Attribute Assignment** and **PostConstruct Initialization** are applied universally, ensuring that entities are initialized regardless of the creation method. This includes cases like programmatic creation, Generic REST API calls, or entity management tools.

* **UI-specific initialization**: UI-layer approaches such as **InitEntityEvent**, **Create Action Initializer**, and **Dialog Windows API** are only applied within the context of the respective user interface. These methods will not be executed for entities created outside the UI (e.g., via the Generic REST API).

* **Contextual logic**:
** **InitEntityEvent** is simple and requires minimal code but lacks access to user inputs or contextual data from the calling view.
** **Create Action Initializer** allows some contextual logic from the calling view, making it more flexible.
** **Dialog Windows API** is ideal for workflows where user interaction is needed to determine initialization values.

Use this comparison to select the best initialization approach based on your application's requirements and the level of customization needed.

[[summary]]
== Summary

This guide explored how to set up initial values for entities in Jmix, demonstrating techniques to streamline data entry and ensure consistency across applications. We reviewed direct attribute assignment for static defaults, `@PostConstruct` for more dynamic logic, and UI-based initialization methods like `InitEntityEvent`, `Create Action Initializer`, and the Dialog Windows API. Each approach was illustrated with practical examples from the Petclinic application to highlight its strengths and use cases.

Entity initialization methods are crucial for improving user experience and maintaining data integrity. Direct attribute assignment and `@PostConstruct` ensure universal application of defaults, making them suitable for all creation contexts, including REST API and programmatic use. UI-based approaches, on the other hand, are limited to user interface contexts but provide additional flexibility by incorporating user input or dynamic logic, especially with tools like the Dialog Windows API.

By understanding these approaches and their trade-offs, you can implement initial entity values that align with your application’s needs and workflows. These techniques enable robust, flexible, and consistent data initialization, supporting scalable and maintainable application designs while enhancing usability for end-users.
